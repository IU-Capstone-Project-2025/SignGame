## Project specific progress

### Core Feature Implementation

1. All game features were discussed between the participants, balancedly distributed and completed

2. Design textures and/or animations were issued on all the necessary models

3. Fully developed, trained and integrated ML model

- Training code source: [code]()

- Initial model artifacts: [artifacts]()

4. All work merged in the [main branch](https://github.com/IU-Capstone-Project-2025/SignGame)

*You can view the process of forming individual areas of the game in more detail in the corresponding [branches](https://github.com/IU-Capstone-Project-2025/SignGame/branches)*
